**Battle of AI** is a co-op multiplayer mode for which let the players show their skills against various enemies. It is a cooperative mode in which players are able to choose from 3 available classes: Mage, Samurai, Sniper. 

Players can currently choose between 2 modes - Story, Survival. Story and Survival modes have a difficult tier system of bronze, silver and gold, all of which have skill requirements before they can be tackled.

## Story
The story mode is two-player mode of ten separate arcs. It can be played solo. This mode has ten linear missions of three chapters in which the two players complete objectives that never change.

Each chapter has 3 different difficulty options. Easy allows you to have infinite continues, but rewards you with the worst gear. Gold and Silver allow two or three Continues each, respectively. On Gold difficulty, there are no revives, and no champion can die. 

The story is rewarding to play through, and a complete run should give you enough gear to progress to the next difficulty stage.

## Survival
Survival mode in Battle of AI is a wave-based progression mode where players have to defeat the wave of enemies. Like Story mode, survival mode also has 3 difficulty levels and every level has a different number of waves coming in. Every 3th wave on every level is a boss wave and is difficult for players to cross. Last but not least this mode also has matchmaking and a lobby system like story mode and quickplay.

- Bronze – 5 Waves
- Silver – 10 Waves
- Gold – 15 Waves

## Champions
### Mage
Mages are master spell casters. Their profession mechanic are their abilities to control magical blocks using telekinesis in order to defeat the enemies on a medium distance. Even if they lack in defense, mages are very versatile and have access to a plethora of skills, as attuning to the different patterns also changes their skills. 

The sinister Mage class in Battle of AI provides a truly versatile and multi-faceted combat role for players of all skill ranges. Through deadly powers and comprehensive buffs, the Mage stands as one of the best initial class choices players which thing the skill is more important then power.

### Sniper
One thing to keep in mind is that this is a very agile class and as a Sniper, players need to be moving constantly as they can't take a lot of punishment. They are the squishiest type of character, meaning they can output immense damage but will fall if they take too much themselves.

They learned how to manipulate the magical blocks in order to enchant their weapons and also create various missiles using them. Snipers are the most effective at long ranges and mostly used for blocking enemy movements and scouting ares which can be attacked. They can also provide help to their teammates by throwing healing grenades which can also damage enemies in a blast of radius.

### Samurai
Samurai players can run straight toward combat and stay there, sustaining their health while chopping enemies down left and right. When you're overwhelmed, use the Lighting Rage ultimate attack to slash through the enemies in a flurry of strikes long strikes.

Wielding the most traditional of Samurai weaponry, a katana, this class is the most balanced of the 3. While not quite as powerful in every regard as other classes, the Samurai will help your team survive multiple waves which are trying to destroy your world. His abilities are based on enchanting his weapon using magical blocks and direct attacks, with the ultimate being Lighting Rage. Life Pull drains health from surrounding enemies, while sharp blade boosts your sword damage, and occasionally adds explosive damage to your hits.

## Physics
